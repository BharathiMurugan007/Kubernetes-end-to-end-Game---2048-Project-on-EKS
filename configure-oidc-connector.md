# IAM OIDC Provider

- The iam-oidc-provider is an AWS resource used to set up an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider in AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management).
- This enables you to allow external identity providers (like Google, Facebook, or any other OIDC-compatible provider) to authenticate users and assume roles within your AWS environment.

# overview of how it works:

## Key Concepts:

- OIDC (OpenID Connect): A protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0 for authentication. It allows you to authenticate users via an identity provider (IdP) and then access resources in AWS by assuming IAM roles.
- IAM Role: An AWS resource that can be assumed by an entity (like a user, service, or application). With an OIDC identity provider, an external identity provider can be used to authenticate and allow a user or service to assume this role.
- OIDC Provider in IAM: The configuration in IAM that represents the OIDC identity provider, where you specify information like the URL of the provider, client ID, and other details.
